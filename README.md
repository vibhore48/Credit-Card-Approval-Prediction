# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction

●	Problem: To predict whether client is eligible for credit card approval.
●	Solution: Employed ML Classification models
o	Fixed imbalanced dataset by employing Re-sampling techniques (SMOTE)
o	Performed feature extraction to get more actionable and workable feature
o	Log transformed features for normal curve and reduced skewness by 85%
o	Binary-encoded feature to reduce columns and made fit for model input
o	Logistic Regression score 81% and Gradient Boosting score increased to 88% with f1_score as 87.5%.
●	Models Used: Machine Learning Classification Algorithm – Linear and Ensemble Technique
